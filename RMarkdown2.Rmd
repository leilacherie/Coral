# Exercise 2 Introduction to Markdown

## Data on compensation

First I want to load the data

```{r}

compensation <-read_csv("compensation.csv")
glimpse(compensation)
```

Then I want to make a graph to explain the data

```{r}
 
ggplot(compensation, aes(x=Root, y= Fruit, colour=Grazing)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("springgreen", "tomato1"))+
  theme_bw()


```

Now I want to explain what is happening here 

```{r}


```




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
